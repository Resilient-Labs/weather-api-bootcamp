# üå¶ Project: Weather API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a city + country and return the temperature in Fahrenheit

<ol>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was simple enough; classic &lt;input&gt; to allow Javascript to add the user input, only I set the type to data <em>a lot like the previous API I did.</em>.  Clickable &lt;button&gt; to start the search.</li>
  <li>The CSS was given a simple layout, more flex for the first.  Tried playing with the actual flex growth instead of resorting to padding, but alas, something about rem just makes things *chef's kiss.*</li>
  <li>The JavaScript behavior, was also kind of simple.  With the help of a fellow cohort, Danny, I was able to knock out the actualy fetch request and spend most of my times styling the page itself.</em></li>
  <li>In the JavaScript lies a variable that makes the temperature conversion easier than selecting the query, so yay for proper use of variables.</em></li>
  <li>Using a conditionals, I also had cute little emoji's pop up depending on the temperature range.</li>
  <li>And that's it, done and dusted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, this one was pretty nice, honesty. Another successful attempt at using API's.  I definitely found out how to create sections to add different bits of information from the API data.  This API project was actually less complex than the last, so I'm thankful for that.  My next task is to make it more complex, and I'll use NASA next. ‚òùüèæ</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>It's simple--the design and the concept, so nothing crazy.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 4 <em>Second verse, same as the first: API's are too bad to understand, it's grabbing the data type you need, I'm seeing.</em></li>
</ul>
