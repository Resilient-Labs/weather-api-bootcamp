## What
This project makes a request to an external server using a weather API. It's purpose is get the weather in any city in the world.

## How it works
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

I used a Fetch API and event listener to send requests to an external server. With a single function, the user will get the weather (current, high, and low) for any city in the world. I converted celsius to fahrenheit using a basic math formula and used the parseInt() method to apply the whole integer.

## Lessons learned
Using an API makes programming more efficient! I understand now when they say do not reinvent the wheel. With just 13 lines of code, a simple app can become sophisticated and clean.
