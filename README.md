This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used an API call to fetch weather data based on City. To specify city when multiple cities have same name, enter Country after. For example, Boston, MA and Boston, United Kingdom to specify which Boston is being referred to since there are multiple cities called Boston in the world.
