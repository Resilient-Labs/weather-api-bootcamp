## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The user is able to enter a city, state and country, then click on get weather button to retrieve data for the specified locaiton. I heavily implemented OOP in this project. I have one class that encapsulates all the properties and methods. I'm also using the fetch web api to make a request to the server.

## Disclamer:

If you clone this project, you need to use your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
