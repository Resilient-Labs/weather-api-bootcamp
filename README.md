# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### Using the user's input to modify the query parameters within the fetch URL to get Fahrenheit or Celcius instead of needing to convert the units.

# Lesson Learned:
#### Making the Javascript more Object Oriented made it easier to keep track of values and scope when calling calling and manipulating those values through methods. This allowed manipulating the DOM much easier and made the code easier to read.
