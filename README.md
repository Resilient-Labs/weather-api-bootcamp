# ðŸŒ¦ Week07 Bootcamp2019a Project: Weather API
This mini application returns the temperature of fahrenheit depending on the city and country you type in.

## How It's Made:
I let the user decide on the parameters value, country and city, to be used within open weather map's api to search and return the json file that contains the temperatue values I want for that city the user searched. I take that temperature value, convert it to fahrenheit and displayed that value into the DOM for the user to see.


## Lessons Learned:
During this project I got a better understanding on fetching apis and fat arrow function syntaxes.
