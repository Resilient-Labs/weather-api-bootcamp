# Weather API ðŸŒ¦ 

<a href="https://kellychhe-weather-api.netlify.app/">I made a weather API website</a> where the user enters a city and country and it shows the current temperature of that location.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

This was the first project where I fetched using two different urls to get the information I needed. I translated the city and country to longitude and latitude using a geo API. Then I used the latitude and longitude values as query parameters to get the temperature. I also used the units parameter to convert from standard to imperial. The CSS is super simple and I thought the background image was cute.

## Lessons Learned 

With this project, I learned how to plug in data from one API as parameters for another API.
