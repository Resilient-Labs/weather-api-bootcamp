# Weather Map
The objective was to use a weather API to allow user to input city and country and receive a temperature in Fahrenheit

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Really just used some basic HTML & CSS along with the ES6 I used after fetching the data from weathermap.

## Optimizations
There's a lot that can be done here, like retrieving and displaying other weather information like precipitation. Could also add in Javascript to automatically capitalize the first letter in the city and country names in the result, even if users inputted lowercase. Also need to do general styling to make it look nice.

## Lessons Learned:

I once again learned how annoying scope can be and how to counter that by using parameters & arguments
