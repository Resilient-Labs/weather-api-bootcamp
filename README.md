# About this project
This project uses the NASA Api to enter a date and display the name, picture, and description of an image or video NASA took that day of outer space.


## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

The user enters a date which is then entered in the URL of the NASA api. JSON is used to fetch the image and description and display it in the HTML.



## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time experimenting with APIs. It was very fun to learn how much can be done with code and how powerful Javascript is.
