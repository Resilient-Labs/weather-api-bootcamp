## Design and Development:
**Tech Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, JSON: 
Using Open Weather's API, users can enter their city and country (2 letter code) to get the temperature in Farenheit.

## Reflections:
A fairly simple API call. Open Weather returns temperature in Kelvin so use conversion formula to get Farenheit.
