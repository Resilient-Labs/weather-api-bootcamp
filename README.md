## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

I focused on finding a solid and reliable weather API and utilizing it to display the current temperature and and current overcast data.  

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

This was an introductorary to using API's and fetching data from them and then manipulating the DOM. This was a good project to practice using template literals.
