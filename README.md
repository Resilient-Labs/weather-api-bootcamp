# Simple Weather App
This is a small app that returns the current weather in any city nationally and internationally.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I made this by using the Open Weather API. I retrieved the latitude and longitude of every location from the JSON file and added it to the DOM to return the weather in whatever location the user inputs.

## Lessons Learned:

THrough building this project, I learned how APIs work. I learned about JSON and how JSON is basically a giant array that holds a bunch of objects with key-value pairs you can access using a combination of dot notation or optional brackets to select which index you need from the JSON array. I learned how to append newly created elements with the appendChild method to add to the DOM to make new elements appear in my HTML.
