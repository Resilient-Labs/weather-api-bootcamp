## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a simple API design for weather web application with a simple input and button. I used CSS to margin the input and button to center them. Next I centered the current temperature of that city & country temperature. Lastly I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the input and button to request for of the current temperatures for any city and country that the user requests for.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can hardcode multiple variables into the URL of the API to allow the users to input whatever they want and the API will request for the users input.
