## Project Description

The WeatherApp is a simple yet efficient weather application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can input a city and country to receive detailed information about the current weather, including temperature, "feels like" temperature, cloud conditions, and a visual representation of the current weather conditions in that area. The project aims to provide users with a fast and visually appealing way to check the weather.

## How It's Made üõ†Ô∏è

- **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Fetch API
- **Project Organization:**
  - Organized project into folders: css (for styles), js (for JavaScript files), and the root folder containing README and index.html.
- **Dynamic Animations:**
  - Utilized `classList.add` in JavaScript to dynamically add animations to elements, enhancing the user experience.

## Lessons Learned üß†

- **Fetch API and Template Literals:**
  - Acquired skills in using the Fetch API to retrieve weather data dynamically.
  - Enhanced knowledge of template literals for efficient string interpolation.
- **Visual Representation Challenges:**
  - Faced challenges in obtaining and displaying a picture that matches the current weather conditions.
  - Successfully utilized OpenWeatherMap's icons in the JSON object to create a visually appealing PNG file for the application.
