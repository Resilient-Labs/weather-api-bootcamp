# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. Used an API to extract data
and display it back on the DOM.
# Lessons Learned
This was a big step for me in learning how I could get a potential user to interact with an API on an
application. It showed me how I can take input from someone browsing the page, and give them the option
to obtain useful information. It also further demonstrated the capibilties of what an API can do.
