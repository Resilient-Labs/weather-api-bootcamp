# Weather API Project
This weather project utilized an openweathermap api. The user will input a city and receive the weather for this city.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

With the weather returning in kelvin it took me some time to figure out how to convert the result from kelvin to Fahrenheit. After doing that, I then learned I had to getElementById within the temp converter function.
