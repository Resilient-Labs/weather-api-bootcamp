### How It's Made:
  Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  To create the weather API I first searched for a open weather API. After I found the API I then fetched it within my JavaScript. The site intially made the         degree's convert to a tempertature other then Fahrenheit, so I added a line of code to display the proper temperature scale.
  
### Lessons Learned:

By creating this website I learned the importance of reading and understanding the documentation that comes with some API's.
