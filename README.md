# ðŸŒ¦ Project: Weather API

### This API project enables a user to enter a city + country (or just a city) and return the temperature in Fahrenheit

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API documentation to code this project.

This project was very entertaining to complete and helped simplify the idea of APIs and their implementation.

### Lessons Learned :

- I got more familiar with JS methods like Number.parseFloat and .toFixed()
- This project really helped my visualize DOM manipulation better as well.
