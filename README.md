# Weather API

Users are able to enter in a city or country, and receive the current weather, what it feels like, precipitation, and humidity of that location.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

First API project. I think the hardest part of this actually looking for a weather API that wasn't broken, paid, and let you put in the inputs you needed for the project. This one took a little bit of work, but I really wanted to use it because it had a cute weather icon. I was able to make it work with a bit of fiddling, and I'm pretty happy with how it came out.
