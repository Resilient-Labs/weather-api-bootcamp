# My Weather API App
In this project I created a web app that uses a weather api to grab the weather of a specific city.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I built this website using html so the user can input the location they want the weather from inside forms. Also I used JS to fetch the api for the information displayed when a city and country are entered. 

## Lessons Learned:

When creating this project I learned how to properly find the api I'm looking for and call it within in my JS. Also how to display that information in my HTML.
